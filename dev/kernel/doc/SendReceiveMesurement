                           Pinball Kernel for TS-7200

                            Send/Receive Performance
                           ==========================

1. Setup
========

The set up is that the receiver is that the sender is launched before the
receiver, and the receiver is at a higher priority than the sender.  The sender
will query the nameserver for the receiver.

Once receiver is found, the sender will Send.  At this point the receiver should
executed Receive already because it is at a higher priority.  Therefore there
will be the need to move the sender into the receiver's send queue.  This is to
maximize the transaction time.

We run the test 10 times and take the worst case measurement.


2. Measurements
===============

We are using CLK_3 with 2000Hz clock source.

* 64 bytes Send
---------------

The communication finished within 2 clock ticks, which means it took 0.5 ~ 1.5
ms.


* 4 bytes Send
--------------

The communication finished within 2 clock tick, which means it took less than
0.5 ~ 1.5 ms.


3. Analysis
===========

The 64-byte send takes about the same worst case time than 4-byte send. This
shows that the part the most time spend on when two tasks communicating with
each other is trap handling, which includes:
- Trap entry/exit
- Trap decoding
- Queuing transactions
- Scheduling decisions

The part that does not affect the performance as much, in this case, is the
message copying (i.e. the memcpy of message from sender to receiver).
