                                Project Proposal
                           ==========================

Overview
========

In the project we have these goals:

- Plan the train for trips with deadlines so collision does not happen, and
  possibly provide plans that minimize the time for total trips.  The goal is to
  have a generalized algorithm that generates interesting results such as making
  a train to follow another train with lower speed if necessary to obtain
  optimal trip time.
- Improved real time detection of collisions, so that in some reservations
  failure cases one of the trains involved can continue to run.
- Ability to take arbitrary train with minimal user input.
- Ability to track and control > 2 trains.
- Ability to make an AI to operate the system randomly and flawlessly.


Technical Challenges
====================

- To plan without collision a higher level reservation system is needed to
  preserve the sections on the track with time windows and ability to change
  reservations in case of any unexpected situation.
- The path finding algorithm might need to integrate with the said higher level
  reservation system in order to minimize trip time.
- Implementing the higher level reservation system, integrating it into the path
  finding algorithm, and implementing the AI requires great amount of careful
  designing and programming effort.


Technical Solutions
===================

- The current plan for the higher level reservation system is to have each edge
  on the track be cut into finer pieces so the trips can be planned with a finer
  route.  The final route will still be organized in terms of nodes despite of
  the finer cuts, as this reservation system is there solely to avoid collision
  at trip planning phase.  The time windows will be given by the path finding
  algorithm, as it is more aware of the condition of the train, such as speed
  and how the train is going to run.
- The path finding algorithm will be aware of the higher level reservation
  system and make use of these information to implement trips for requested
  train routing.  With the reservation at hand many interesting routings
  involving change of train speed and reversing at switches can be implemented.
- Essentially the higher level reservation system implements a mechanism to
  manipulate and synchronize reservations for tracks to avoid collision, and the
  path finding algorithm implements the policy for minimizing the trip time.
