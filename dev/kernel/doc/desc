1. Kernel Overview
==================


* Design Goal
-------------

The pinball kernel is designed to be a real time micro-kernel running on TS-7200
board.  Its design goals includes:

 - Constant trap time
 - Cooperative multi-tasking
 - Easy kernel programming interface
 - Highly modularize


* Functional Units and Data Strucutures
---------------------------------------

The kernel is composed of functional units including memory manager, task
manager, scheduler, trap handler, and basic device drivers (UART and clock).

Kernel data structures includes the global kernel context, task descriptor,
generic ring buffer, doubly linked circular list, syscall descriptor, and data
structures internal to each functional modules, such as memory descriptor, task
array, scheduling queues, console descriptors etc.


* Memory Management
-------------------

All memory needed are pre-allocated on the kernel stack and managed by the
memory manager.


2. Components Highlight
=======================

* Memory Manager
----------------

The memory manager manages allocation and deallocation of volatile data
structures such as task descriptors and stack memory for user tasks.  For each
type of memory the memory manager maintains a ring buffer initialized with all
possible allocations.  Notice this can be done because both the size of a task
descriptor and the size of a user stack are fixed, so all the ring buffer need
to record are the pointers to each one of the pre-allocated data structure.

Then allocation is simply a ring buffer get operation and free is a put
operation, both taking constant time.  Initialization can be done by a bunch of
puts, and out of memory detection is equivalent to a ring buffer empty.


* Global Kernel Context
-----------------------

To avoid using global variables to store global or local information, every
functional unit was designed to keep its operational data into a data structure
which is stored in the global kernel context.  The global kernel context is a
data structure holding all the information needed by each of the functional
units.  Itself and its contents are all allocated on the kernel stack.

All kernel API takes a Context pointer pointing to the global kernel context and
retrieve operational data from it, thus avoiding the use of global variables.
The global kernel context is always saved on the top of the kernel stack once
the system enters user mode, so the trap handler and other functional units can
always find the global kernel context.


* Syscall Descriptor
--------------------

Instead of passing the trap reason through paramter to swi, it was chosen to
pass the the trap reason through a1 register.  This gave us more power.

The reference passed into the kernel through a1 register is a data structure
allocated on the user stack containing all possible parameter needed by the
kernel, including the trap reason code, input data buffer, output data buffer,
and syscall integer return value.  This allows very easy kernel programming
especially when we start to implement message passing.


* Task Descriptor
-----------------

The task descriptor consists information needed for each task.

The task descriptor keeps record of tid, state, priority, current stack pointer,
parent tid, parent pointer (point to parent task), syscall descrioptor, a
listhead, and a send queue.


3. Component Details
====================

* Data Structures
-----------------

- Generic Ring Buffer

The generic ring buffer is supposed to be a simple and robust ring buffer
implementation.  The ring buffer supports put and get operations.  Each instance
has a pre-allocated buffer provided by user, get and put indices, and the
element size.  The buffer contains a copy of the data sent to the buffer.  Each
put and get thus requires a memcpy.

This serve as a basic building block for many data structures.


- Generic Doubly Linked Circular List

The list implementation is partially taken from the Linux kernel list.h.  This
list implementation has the advantage of being type neutural, thus enable the
group to implement lists of different data structures easily.


- Syscall Descriptor

The syscall descriptor describes a syscall.  It is constructed on the user stack
and passed into the trap handler every time a syscall occurs.

A syscall descriptor contains the trap reason, return value, input buffer, and
output buffer.  This makes trap handler much simpler because it does not need to
search for the parameters passed into the kernel.


- Memory Descriptor

A memory descriptor is essentially a set of ring buffers.  Each ring buffer
contains all possible allocations to a certain kind of memory, such as task
descriptors or stack spaces.  The memory manager take an enum to distinguish on
which ring buffer should the memory manager operates.


- Task Array

The task array is a pre-allocated array of all task descriptors on the kernel
stack.  It is used for memory manager to initialize its task memory descriptor,
but it is also stored in the global kernel context for message passing syscalls
to find the target task.


- Scheduling Queues

The scheduling queue is basically a ring of double linked list, with a pointer
points to the head. Since it is a ring, accessing the tail is simply finding the
prev element of the head.


- Console Descriptors

The console descriptors contains the information needed by the console device
driver.  It contains the specs of the UART port and result of read/write
operations.


* Functional Units
------------------

- Memory Manager

The memory manager uses the memory descriptors to allocate memory.  Since the
memory descriptors are simply ring buffers, a mem_alloc is just a wrapper of
rbuf_get, and similarly a mem_free is just a rbuf_put.

All memory needed by the memory manager, as well as all the operational data
needed by all other units, are allocated in main and passed in to either the
memory manager or the global kernel context.


- Task Manager

A task manager is used to create and initialize task descriptors and associated
stack space.

A new task will have its stack initialized as if the task was saved by the trap
handler, and can be restored/launched by the trap handler.


- Scheduler

The scheduler consists 32 scheduling queues, indexed from 0 to 31, indicating
the 32 different priority levels. In order to quickly locate the first non-empty
queue, a 32-bit selector, of which each bit indicates if a corresponding queue
is empty or not. Moreover, the scheduler has a zombie queue for tasks that are
finished. The scheduler will schedule the first task in the queue with highest
priority. If there is not any task in any of the scheduling queues, the
scheduler will tell the handler to run kernel.


- Trap Handler

The trap handler is the main entry point of the kernel space from the user space.

For kernel assignment 1, the trap handler takes 1 parameter: the syscall
descriptor.  At entry the trap handler entry code saves the current processor
states out to the user's stack, and pass the syscall descriptor, user stack
pointer and kernel stack pointer into the syscall handler.  The syscall handler
handles the syscall, calls scheduler to schedule the next task, and then calls
into the trap handler exit code.  The trap handler exit code will restore the
scheduled task and set processor back into user space.

One thing worth mention here is that the trap exit code is called by the syscall
handler, rather than make the syscall handler return into the trap entry code to
exit.  This is because the trap exit code needs some parameters from the syscall
handler, so calling the trap exit code is more natural.

The reason the kernel stack pointer is needed by the syscall handler is exactly
because the trap exit code needs this address to forcifully restore the kernel
stack.


- Console Driver

This driver is essentially the UART driver.  It supports everything the bwio
supports, although the implementation was slightly different.  This driver is
not doing busy wait by default, but report how many bytes were written to the
port.  It also provides APIs for setting the cursor, so it would be easier to
draw the UI.

The reason bwio is not sufficient is because bwio is always doing busy waiting.
Also a seperate implementation integrates with our code base better.


- Clock Driver

This driver setup the clock.  It mainly support reporting the number of cycles
the clock has been up.


4. Kernel Launch Process
========================

The kernel follows this process to launch:

 - Initialize task descriptor array, assigning initial tid
 - Initialize global kernel context, pass in all operational data structures
 - Pass all pre-allocated task descriptors and stack memory into memory manager
 - Initialize scheduler
 - Initialize device drivers
 - Allocate the first user task
 - Initialize/setup the first user task
 - Enter the user mode and launch the first user task through trap handler


5. Trap Process
===============

The kernel follows this process when swi is issued:

- Enters system mode
- Save out user data
- Pass user sp into a2
- Enter supervisor mode
- Save user pc and cpsr onto user stack
- Go into syscall handler

Once the syscall handler completes the syscall, it calls trap exit code which
undo these steps.

6. Blocking
===========

To implement blocking we simply remove the task from the ready queue it belongs
to and put it in a queue (the send queue for instance) that sooner or later
someone will come and responde to.  When the response is completed the task is
back to the ready queue, essentially unblock the task.


7. User Space Syscall Wrapper
=============================

The userland program make a syscall by calling one of the user space syscall
routine.  Each syscall routine sets up its own syscall descriptor, then calls
into the syscall wrapper.  The syscall wrapper will have its first parameter
being the syscall descriptor, so that once in the kernel the trap handler can
obtain the syscall descriptor from a1 register.

The syscall wrapper then simply executes swi.
